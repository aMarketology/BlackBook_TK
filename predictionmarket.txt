📊 BlackBook Prediction Market - Database Design Context
🎯 Core Principles for Database Schema Design
Based on your requirements, we need to ensure our Supabase database schema strictly follows prediction market principles:

🔒 Zero Protocol Risk (Constant Sum Formula)
Database Implications:

Market liquidity must always balance across all outcomes
Share calculations must be deterministic and verifiable
No fractional share creation that could lead to protocol debt
Atomic bet placement to prevent race conditions
⚡ Fast AMM Calculations (~0.1ms)
Database Implications:

Pre-computed price tables for instant lookups
Minimal JOIN operations in critical paths
Indexed calculations for real-time price updates
Cached market state to avoid recalculation
🔗 Balance Verification (Blockchain Integration)
Database Implications:

Transaction hash tracking for every bet
Block number confirmation before finalizing bets
Reconciliation tables for blockchain sync
Rollback mechanisms for failed transactions
🏗️ Clean Separation (Modular Design)
Database Implications:

Clear data ownership between on-chain and off-chain
Event sourcing for audit trails
State snapshots for quick recovery
API-first design for external integrations
🧮 Mathematical Constraints for Schema
1. Constant Sum Market Maker (CSMM)
2. Share Conservation
3. Price Bounds (0 < price < 1)
🚀 Performance Requirements
Target Metrics:
Market Creation: < 100ms
Bet Placement: < 50ms
Price Calculation: < 0.1ms
Market Listing: < 200ms
Real-time Updates: < 10ms latency
Database Design Priorities:
Read-Heavy Optimization (90% reads, 10% writes)
Real-time Price Feeds (WebSocket subscriptions)
Concurrent Bet Handling (ACID compliance)
Historical Data Queries (Analytics & charts)
🔐 Security & Integrity Constraints
Blockchain Sync Requirements:
Market State Machine:
📊 Data Architecture Decisions
What Goes On-Chain:
✅ Bet transactions (amount, outcome, user)
✅ Market resolutions (winning outcome)
✅ Fund transfers (deposits, withdrawals)
✅ Dispute resolutions (if implemented)
What Stays Off-Chain (Supabase):
✅ Market metadata (title, description, category)
✅ User profiles (preferences, history)
✅ Price calculations (cached for speed)
✅ Analytics data (charts, statistics)
✅ Real-time subscriptions (live updates)
Hybrid Data (Both Layers):
🔄 Market state (blockchain = source of truth)
🔄 User balances (blockchain verified, DB cached)
🔄 Bet history (blockchain immutable, DB queryable)
🎯 Next Steps: Schema Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Core Tables ⏭️
Phase 2: Performance Tables
Phase 3: Advanced Features
🔧 Technical Implementation Notes
Database Triggers for CSMM:
Auto-update market liquidity on every bet
Recalculate prices when shares change
Validate sum constraints before commits
Sync blockchain state on confirmations
Real-time Subscriptions:
✅ Ready to Proceed?
With this context established, we can now create a Supabase schema that:

Maintains mathematical integrity (constant sum)
Delivers sub-millisecond performance (cached calculations)
Syncs perfectly with blockchain (verified balances)
Scales cleanly (modular architecture)
Next Action: Implement the Phase 1 core tables with all mathematical constraints and blockchain sync mechanisms built-in.

Should we proceed with creating the mathematically-sound, performance-optimized Supabase schema?
